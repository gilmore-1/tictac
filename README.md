## Features

- Win detection and end game state.
- Reset the game and start over.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click on the squares to make your moves.
4. The game will automatically detect a win or draw and prompt you to play again.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

|-- index.html
|-- style.css
|-- app.js
|-- README.md

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the game board.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game board.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic and DOM manipulation.

## How It Works

The game logic is implemented in the `app.js` file. It uses event listeners to handle user clicks and updates the DOM accordingly. The game checks for win conditions after each move and displays the result when the game is over.
